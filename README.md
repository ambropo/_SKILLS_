# Claude Code Skills for Academic Economists

Custom skills for Claude Code, focused on academic research workflows: paper auditing, literature review, LaTeX compilation, code review, and model solving.

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/amatray/claude-skills-public ~/claude-skills

# 2. Symlink into Claude Code
ln -s ~/claude-skills/skills ~/.claude/skills

# 3. Restart Claude Code (required for new skill directories)

# 4. Verify: type / in Claude Code and confirm skills appear
```

**Important:** Each skill is a directory containing `SKILL.md`. Do NOT copy flat `.md` files into `~/.claude/skills/`; they will be silently ignored.

If you already have skills in `~/.claude/skills/`, merge the contents rather than replacing the directory:

```bash
# Alternative: copy individual skills instead of symlinking the whole directory
cp -r ~/claude-skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```
