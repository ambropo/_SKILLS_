description: >
  Systematically set up, solve, and verify an economic model with step-by-step
  derivations and cross-model mathematical checking. Use when user wants to
  formalize an economic idea into a model, solve a model, derive equilibrium
  conditions, check derivations, or verify mathematical results. Also use when
  user says "solve", "derive", "set up the model", "formalize", "verify the math",
  "check derivation", "model setup".

# solving-model

Orchestrate economic model derivation and verification through five checkpointed phases, each dispatched to a dedicated sub-agent.

## Phase 0: Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `--from=N` | Start at Phase N (1-5), reading prior phase outputs from disk |
| `--verify` | Alias for `--from=3` |
| `--name=X` | Set model name → working directory `solving_models/X/` |
| File path (`.tex`, `.pdf`) | Use as input; detect type by extension |
| Everything else | Treat as verbal model description |

**If `--name` not provided:** Ask the user for a model name using AskUserQuestion.

**Create working directory:**
```bash
mkdir -p solving_models/[name]/
```

**If `--from=N` with N > 1:** Verify prior phase files exist:

| Start phase | Required files |
|-------------|---------------|
| 2 | `model_setup.tex` |
| 3 | `model_setup.tex`, `derivation.tex` |
| 4 | `model_setup.tex`, `derivation.tex`, `verification_log.tex` |
| 5 | `model_setup.tex`, `derivation.tex`, `verification_log.tex`, `comparative_statics.tex` |

If any required file is missing, explain what's needed and suggest the correct `--from` value.

**Detect input type:**
- `.pdf` extension → `INPUT_TYPE=pdf`
- `.tex` extension → `INPUT_TYPE=latex`
- Otherwise → `INPUT_TYPE=verbal`

---

## Phase Dispatch

Execute phases sequentially. Each phase is dispatched as a **sub-agent** that reads its dedicated reference file for full instructions.

**Dispatch pattern for each phase:**

1. Read `references/phase-N-*.md` for the full phase instructions
2. Set context variables: `$MODEL_NAME`, `$WORKING_DIR`, `$INPUT_TYPE`, `$INPUT_CONTENT`
3. Execute the phase following its instructions exactly
4. At the phase CHECKPOINT: present results and wait for user approval via AskUserQuestion
5. **Do NOT proceed to the next phase without explicit user approval**
6. If the user requests changes, re-execute the relevant steps within the current phase

### Phase 1: Model Setup

Read and follow `references/phase-1-setup.md`.

**Summary:** Elicit model primitives → write `model_setup.tex` → Oracle review → checkpoint.

**Skip if:** `--from` >= 2 (read existing `model_setup.tex` instead).

---

### Phase 2: Derivation

Read and follow `references/phase-2-derivation.md`.

**Summary:** Identify targets → derive step-by-step → flag `% VERIFY` → weasel word scan → checkpoint.

**Skip if:** `--from` >= 3 (read existing `derivation.tex` instead).

**Special:** If derivation reveals model setup is incomplete, HALT and offer to return to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 3: Verification

Read and follow `references/phase-3-verification.md`.

**Summary:** Collect flagged steps → user selects Oracle steps → run 3 local checks on all flagged → Oracle blind re-derivation on selected → HALT on any failure → checkpoint.

**"Verify existing" entry:** If `--verify` with an external file, or `--from=3` when `derivation.tex` lacks `\paragraph{Step` labels, Phase 3 begins with step parsing (see the phase file for full parsing specification). Normal `--from=3` resumes (where `derivation.tex` was produced by Phase 2) skip parsing and go straight to verification.

**Critical rules:**
- Oracle receives `model_setup.tex` only — NEVER `derivation.tex`
- Numerical checks execute via Python, not in-context arithmetic
- Any check failure triggers HALT with side-by-side presentation

---

### Phase 4: Comparative Statics

Read and follow `references/phase-4-comp-statics.md`.

**Summary:** User selects parameters → derive and sign → Oracle batched verification → summary table → checkpoint.

**Oracle budget:** Max 5 sign claims per Oracle call. Split automatically if more.

---

### Phase 5: Documentation & Compilation

Read and follow `references/phase-5-documentation.md`.

**Summary:** Assemble `full_model.tex` with `\input{}` → apply formatting → compile → present PDF.

**Critical:** Must `cd` to working directory before `xelatex` (relative `\input` paths). Only `full_model.tex` is compilable — phase files are fragments.

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Oracle timeout/failure | Present error, offer retry or skip. Record "Oracle: SKIPPED (timeout)" in verification log. Show degraded-verification warning at checkpoint. |
| LaTeX compilation failure | Show error log. Try common fixes (missing packages, undefined refs). If stuck, present to user. |
| Missing prior phase files | Explain what's missing, suggest correct `--from=N`. |
| Phase 2 discovers setup gap | Re-execute Phase 1 to amend `model_setup.tex` (backup previous version), then restart Phase 2. Preserve partial `derivation.tex` as `derivation.tex.partial`. |
| Phase file overwrite | Always copy existing `.tex` to `.bak` before overwriting. |

## Oracle Budget

Budget 3-6 Oracle sessions total per model run:
1. Setup review (Phase 1) — 1 call
2. Blind re-derivation (Phase 3) — 1-2 calls (max 5 claims each)
3. Sign verification (Phase 4) — 1-3 calls (max 5 claims each)

## First-Time Usage

On first invocation or when the user seems unfamiliar with the workflow, read `references/example-walkthrough.md` to show them the expected output format for each phase.
