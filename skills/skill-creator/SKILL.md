# Skill Creator

The core loop (RED–GREEN–REFACTOR):

1. Decide what the skill does.
2. Write 2–3 pressure-test scenarios — the kind of prompt where a naive agent would fail or cut corners.
3. **RED**: run scenarios *without* a skill. Capture verbatim what the agent does and how it rationalizes any failures.
4. **GREEN**: draft the skill targeted at the observed failures. Don't write defenses against problems you didn't see.
5. Re-run scenarios *with* the skill. Verify behavior actually changed.
6. Review outputs with the user (qualitatively) and assertions (quantitatively).
7. **REFACTOR**: close loopholes from new rationalizations that emerge under the skill.
8. Repeat 4–7 until satisfied.
9. Optimize the description for triggering accuracy.

Why baseline first: skills get written against imagined failures and end up bloated with defenses against problems the agent would never have made. Watching the unaided baseline tells you what actually breaks — and whether the skill is needed at all. If the baseline already does the right thing, stop.

Figure out where the user is in this loop and pick up from there. If they say "just vibe with me, skip the evals", do that — but resist skipping the baseline; it's cheap and decides whether the skill earns its existence.

## Creating a skill

### Capture intent

Extract from conversation history first. The user may already have given you the workflow, tools used, input/output formats, and corrections. Confirm gaps, then ask:

1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?
2. When should it trigger (user phrases, contexts)?
3. What's the expected output format?
4. Test cases worth setting up? Skills with verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code, fixed workflows) benefit from tests. Subjective skills (style, art) often don't.

Research in parallel via subagents (or inline) if useful.

### Frontmatter

Only `name` and `description` are required. Optional fields earn their place:

- `name` — kebab-case slug; must match the folder name.
- `description` — primary triggering mechanism. **Describe only WHEN to use the skill, not WHAT it does.** Start with "Use when…" and list concrete triggers, symptoms, and contexts. Reason: when the description summarizes the workflow, Claude follows the description and skips reading the skill body — the skill becomes documentation Claude ignores. The skill body is for *what*; the description is only for *when*. Claude also undertriggers, so be a little pushy on coverage: list multiple phrasings the user might use, including indirect ones.

  ✅ Good: `Use when the user asks to audit, review, or critique an economics manuscript, or mentions checking a paper for typos, structure, or AI-generated language.`
  ❌ Bad: `Audits papers by running seven modules — typos, grammar, style, prose, apparatus, voice, AI patterns — then reports findings. Use when reviewing a paper.` (summarizes workflow, will cause Claude to skip the body)
- `argument-hint` — optional. Shown in `/` autocomplete (e.g. `"[path-to-file]"`, `"[--clean] [path]"`).
- `allowed-tools` — optional but load-bearing when set. Restricts which tools the skill can call. List every tool needed, including MCP tools.

Example:

```yaml
---
name: review-paper
description: Use when the user asks to review, audit, or critique an economics manuscript, or mentions checking a paper for argument structure, econometric specification, citation completeness, or referee objections.
argument-hint: "[path to .tex or .pdf]"
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Write", "Task"]
---
```

### Anatomy

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md       (required)  routing + workflow
├── gotchas.md     (optional)  failure modes the agent reads to catch itself
├── templates/     (optional)  artifacts the skill EMITS verbatim or fills in
├── references/    (optional)  prose the skill READS to understand
├── scripts/       (optional)  executable code for deterministic tasks
└── assets/        (optional)  static files used in output (icons, fonts)
```

Three loading levels:

1. **Metadata** (name + description) — always in context (~100 words).
2. **SKILL.md body** — loaded when the skill triggers. Target the range Anthropic skill examples cluster in (roughly 150–300 lines); past that, dispatch heavy content to subfolders. The signal is whether failure catalogues or worked examples are crowding out routing.
3. **Bundled resources** — loaded on demand; scripts can run without being read into context.

Decide subfolder by what the agent does with the content:

- **emit** → `templates/`  (HTML scaffold, .tex skeleton with placeholder sections, response-letter shell)
- **read to understand** → `references/`  (schemas, principles, taxonomies, worked examples, rubric criteria)
- **read to catch itself** → `gotchas.md`  (rationalization table, red-flags list, pressure-scenario failure notes)

`scripts/` and `assets/` are orthogonal to this trichotomy: executable code and static output files. The emit/read/catch distinction applies to content the agent processes as prose.

Boundary case: if the agent reads something to decide *what* to emit (a rubric it applies as a checklist), it's `references/`. If the agent copies the structure into output (a skeleton with section headers), it's `templates/`. A rubric printed verbatim is the rare both-case; file under `references/` and let the template reference it. Worked examples go in `references/` even if their structure is partially copied; templates are bare skeletons, examples are filled prose the agent learns from.

Example: a paper-audit skill with seven failure modes and three rubrics lands at SKILL.md (routing + workflow), `gotchas.md` (rationalization table, red-flags list, observed failures from testing), `references/rubrics.md` (the three rubrics the agent reads), `templates/response-letter.tex` (the skeleton the agent fills in).

For multi-domain skills, split references by variant (`references/aws.md`, `references/gcp.md`, …) and have SKILL.md route. Not every skill uses every subfolder.

Existing skills predate this anatomy and need not be migrated unless touched.

### Writing patterns

Use the imperative. Explain *why*, not just *what* — modern LLMs do better with reasoning than with rigid `MUST`s. If you're reaching for `ALWAYS` / `NEVER` in caps, reframe with the reasoning instead.

Output formats: state them as a template the model can match.

```markdown
## Report structure
Use this template:
# [Title]
## Executive summary
## Key findings
## Recommendations
```

Examples carry weight:

```markdown
**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication
```

### Discipline-enforcing skills

For skills whose job is to make the agent *follow a rule* (not just produce an output), the agent will find loopholes under pressure. Three techniques close them. Skip this subsection for technique or reference skills, where the agent isn't tempted to cheat.

**1. Foundational sentence.** State once, early: *"Violating the letter of the rule is violating the spirit."* This single sentence cuts off the entire class of "I'm following the spirit, just not the letter" rationalization. Place it at the top of the rule section.

**2. Rationalization table.** When the agent invents excuses to skip the rule, document each verbatim with a one-line reality check. Build the table from *observed* failures during testing, not from imagination:

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I already tested it manually" | Manual tests don't replay. Write the assertion. |
| "Tests-after achieve the same goals" | Tests-after = "what does this do?" Tests-first = "what should this do?" |

The table doesn't need to be complete on first draft. Add rows every time you catch a new rationalization in testing.

**3. Red-flags list.** A short list of warning signs the agent can self-check against, with a single hard instruction at the end:

```
## Red Flags — STOP

- Code before test
- "It's about spirit not ritual"
- "This is different because…"
- "I'll add the test after"

All of these mean: stop, start over.
```

Together: the foundational sentence forbids spirit-vs-letter arguments, the table names the excuses, the red-flags list lets the agent catch itself mid-rationalization. Without these, "always do X" gets eroded the first time the agent finds X inconvenient.

If the rationalization table or Red Flags list grows past ~15 lines combined (heuristic, not a hard limit), hoist both to `gotchas.md` and replace the inline content with: `See gotchas.md — rationalization table and red-flags list.` Reason: rationalization catalogues compound as you observe new excuses; inlining them bloats SKILL.md on every trigger.

**Deeper reading**: `references/persuasion-principles.md` covers the empirical basis (Cialdini, 2021; Meincke et al., 2025, N=28,000) for which persuasion levers — authority, commitment, scarcity, social proof, unity — actually move compliance in LLMs, and which to avoid (liking, reciprocity). Load it when writing a discipline-enforcing skill.


## Workflow References

Two phases live in `references/` because they only fire when the author is doing that specific activity, not every time the skill triggers:

| Phase | When it runs | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Evals (test cases, baseline, running, iteration loop) | After the skill is drafted and the author wants to test it | `references/eval-workflow.md` |
| Description optimization | After the skill is in good shape, to tune triggering accuracy | `references/description-optimization.md` |

Load the reference when you reach that phase, then follow its instructions verbatim. The authoring loop above (capture intent, frontmatter, anatomy, writing patterns, discipline-enforcing skills) is enough to draft a working skill; the references are for testing and polishing.


---

## Package and present

If the `present_files` tool is available:

```bash
python -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>
```

Point the user at the resulting `.skill` file. Skip this step if `present_files` isn't available.

---

## Claude.ai

Same loop (draft → test → review → improve → repeat), but no subagents:

- **Test cases**: run each in series yourself by reading SKILL.md and following its instructions. Less rigorous (you wrote it and you're running it), but a useful sanity check. Skip baselines.
- **Reviewing**: no browser → present results inline. For file outputs (.docx, .xlsx), save to filesystem and tell the user where. Ask "How does this look?" inline.
- **Benchmarking**: skip — without baselines, the numbers aren't meaningful.
- **Description optimization**: skip — needs `claude -p` from Claude Code.
- **Blind comparison**: skip — needs subagents.
- **Packaging**: works anywhere with Python and a filesystem.

### Updating an existing skill

- **Preserve the original name** (directory and frontmatter `name`). Don't append `-v2`.
- **Copy to a writeable location before editing** (installed paths may be read-only). Work in `/tmp/skill-name/`, package from the copy.
- If packaging manually, stage in `/tmp/` first, then move to the output directory.
- **Check for hoist candidates.** If the skill has a Red Flags or rationalization-table section inline and those lines exceed 15 combined, propose hoisting them to `gotchas.md` per the threshold in Anatomy. State the current line count and the proposed split before editing.

---

## Cowork

- Subagents available — the main parallel workflow works. If timeouts hit, fall back to serial runs.
- No display: pass `--static <output_path>` to `generate_review.py` to produce a standalone HTML file the user can open.
- **Generate the eval viewer before doing any qualitative review yourself.** Get the outputs in front of the user first.
- Feedback: "Submit All Reviews" downloads `feedback.json`. Read from the downloaded location.
- Packaging works.
- Description optimization works (`run_loop.py` uses `claude -p` via subprocess, no browser). Save it for the end, after the skill is in good shape.

---

## Advanced: blind comparison

Optional. For "is the new version actually better?", give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, let it judge, then analyze why the winner won. See `agents/comparator.md` and `agents/analyzer.md`. Most users won't need this.
